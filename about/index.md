I'm Beilei Bian. I got my Master Degree in School of Statistics from [Renmin University of China](http://www.ruc.edu.cn). During these 2 years, my research interest is solving real world problems with computational statistics methods. My mentor is [Prof.YangLi](http://stat.ruc.edu.cn/teacher_more.php?id=66&cid=25) who is a smart, hard-working and easy-going character. I think it's difficult for me to make progress in statistics without his help. So thanks a lot ðŸ˜Œ

Before that I got my BSc in College of Animal Science and Technology from [China Agricultural University](http://www.cau.edu.cn). Animal Science is a very interesing area which mainly focuses on animal genetics, nutrition, reproduction, animal welfare... Thanks CAU, she always taught me how to be a better man.
