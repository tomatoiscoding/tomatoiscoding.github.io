I'm Beilei Bian. I got my Master Degree in School of Statistics from [Renmin University of China](http://www.ruc.edu.cn). During these 2 years, my research interest is solving real world problems with computational statistics methods. My mentor is Prof.YangLi who is a smart, hard-working and easy-going character. I think it's difficult for me to make progress in statistics without his help. So thanks a lot??

Before that I got my BSc in College of Animal Science and Technology from [China Agricultural University](http://www.cau.edu.cn). Animal Science is an very interesing area which mainly focuses on animal genetics, nutrition, reproduction, animal welfare... Thanks CAU, she always taught me how to be a better man.

Now I'm an algorithm engineer @WeGene, Shenzhen. My research interest is machine learning and data mining in large scale genomic data. I think we'll do our best in DNA to Customer in China even in all over the world.
